# ADR 003: Use Spartan NG UI Library

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a modern, accessible, and customizable UI component library for our application. The library should align with our design goals, support rapid development, and be actively maintained. It should also integrate well with Tailwind CSS and provide a consistent user experience.

## Decision

We will use the Spartan NG UI library as our primary source for UI components in the application.

## Consequences

- Developers will use Spartan NG components to build the application UI, reducing the need for custom component development.
- The project benefits from a consistent, accessible, and modern design system.
- The library is designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, supporting our existing styling approach.
- Team members must become familiar with Spartan NGâ€™s components and documentation.
- The build process will include the Spartan NG package as a dependency.
