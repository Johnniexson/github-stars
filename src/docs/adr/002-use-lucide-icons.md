# ADR 002: Use Lucide Icons for Application Icons

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We require a consistent, modern, and flexible icon set for our application. The icon library should be open-source, actively maintained, and easy to integrate with our technology stack. It should also provide a wide range of icons suitable for various UI needs.

## Consequences

- Developers will use Lucide’s Angular package to add icons to components and templates.
- The project benefits from a modern, customizable, and lightweight icon set.
- The icon library is open-source and actively maintained, ensuring long-term support.
- Team members must become familiar with Lucide’s usage and available icons.
